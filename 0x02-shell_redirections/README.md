Scripts for shell redirections on the linux command line.

I/O Redirections:

I/O (Input/Output) redirections are techniques used to control where the input and output of commands go.
Common I/O redirection operators include:
>: Redirects standard output (stdout) to a file. For example, command > output.txt saves the output of "command" to "output.txt."
<: Redirects standard input (stdin) from a file. For example, command < input.txt takes input for "command" from "input.txt."
>>: Appends stdout to a file. For example, command >> output.txt appends the output of "command" to "output.txt."
2>: Redirects standard error (stderr) to a file. For example, command 2> error.txt redirects error messages to "error.txt."
|: Connects the stdout of one command to the stdin of another command (pipe). For example, command1 | command2 passes the output of "command1" as input to "command2."



Filters:

Filters are commands or programs that process and transform text data, often line by line.
Common Unix filters include:
grep: Searches for text patterns in input and extracts matching lines.
sed: A stream editor for text manipulation, often used for search and replace operations.
awk: A versatile text processing tool for extracting and manipulating data fields.
sort: Sorts lines of text data.
uniq: Removes duplicate lines from sorted input.
cut: Extracts specific columns or fields from lines of text.
wc: Counts lines, words, and characters in text input.
Filters are often used in combination with pipes and I/O redirections to perform complex data processing tasks.

Using the shell, I/O redirections, and filters, you can efficiently manage and manipulate data, automate tasks, and build powerful command-line workflows in Unix-like environments.
